# Viewing SVGs  
Now that you know how to write and SVG, it's time to see it in action! This page covers different ways to view SVGs.  

---

## Option 1: Save as a File
1. Save your SVG code in a file with the `.svg` extension, like `example.svg`.
2. Open the file in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari).
    - The browser will render the SVG directly.

## Option 2: Embed in an HTML File
You can also include SVGs directly in an HTML document:  
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
        <h1> My SVG! </h1>
        <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="200" height="100">
            <rect x="10" y="10" width="200" height="100" fill="blue" />
        </svg>
    </body>
</html>
```

1. Save this code in a file with the `.html` extension, like `example.html`.
2. Open it in a browser to see your SVG embedded in a webpage.
